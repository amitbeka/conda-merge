"""Tool to merge environment files of the conda package manager.

Given a list of environment files, print a unified environment file.
Usage: conda-merge file1 file2 ... [> unified-environment]

Merge strategy for each part of the definition:
  name: keep the last name, if any is given (according to the order of the files).
  channels: merge the channel priorities of all files and keep each file's priorities
    in the same order. If there is a collision between files, report an error.
  dependencies: merge the dependencies and remove duplicates, sorts alphabetically.
    conda itself can handle cases like [numpy, numpy=1.7] gracefully so no need
    to do that. You may beautify the dependencies by hand if you wish.
    The script also doesn't detect collisions, relying on conda to point that out.
